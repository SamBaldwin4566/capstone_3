# Capstone Project 3 - Object Orientated Programming
For my third capstone project we recently began learning all about OOP as well as furthering out knowledge of functions. The idea behind this task was to create a system that manages different kinds of employees in a sales department and how their wage at the end of each month differs depending on their sales.

At this point of the bootcamp we had only covered JavaScript and very minimal HTML. As I want to show my journey I have left the HTML very basic please see my future projects to see what I can do with HTML/CSS.
